    <h2>Animals in captivity: Consumption</h2>
    <p> This overview shows the total amount (in tons) of animals used for meat consumption in Europe. This amount
        is based on the weight of approved meat, meaning more animals were slaughtered than used eventually. This data
        was retrieved from the
        <a href="https://data.europa.eu/euodp/en/data/publisher/estat?q=production+of+meat&ext_boolean=all&sort=">EU Open Data Portal</a>.
        This information is indicative though not completely representative as not all European countries were included
        due to a lack of data for some (due to confidentiality). These countries were left out in all visualizations, meaning
        the total weight is higher and the proportions may differ slightly.</p>
    <p>The countries that were excluded are: <i>the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Norway, and Liechtenstein.</i></p>
