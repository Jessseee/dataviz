            <p>In this graph the amount of zoo's in the United states is shown together with the intensity of the regulations regarding exotic pet ownership. To add up to that, the amount of inhabitants of the different states is portrayed on the y axis to distinguish between states with a lot of inhabitant and state with less inhabitants, this is done to make sure that the data is less misleading. From the visualisation we can derrive that there are just a few states with small law-restrictions. When you take a closer look between the intensities 3 and 4, tou can see that small states with the intensity 3 have more zoos than small states with the intensity 4. This could mean that there is a slight relation between the intensity of laws regarding exotic animal ownership and the amount of zoos per state in the US.</p><br>

            <p>In this area range chart the average upper bound of endangered animal species and average lower bound of endangered animal species are shown and grouped by the amount of regulations that are in place to enforce the animal welfare in various coutries around the world. If we take a closer look at the results of the visualisation we can conclude that there are generally more endangered species in coutries with many laws to enforce animal welfare. This could be because the animals in these countries are in freat need of these regulations to prevent them from going extinct.</p>

            <div id="regulations_vs_trophies" data-includeHTML="partials/regulations_vs_trophies.html"></div>
            <p>Exotic animals are often killed by humans for sport. When this happend the carcass of the hunted animal is often sold or kept as a trophy by the hunter. Because these hunting session the biodiversity has dropped in many countries and some of them have installed laws an regulations on hunting for sports to keep the population of specific species stable. For this visualisation we took the data from the 8 biggest exporters of exotic animals towards the United States (the largest importer of animal trophies in the world) and grouped them by their regulations. The result is quite clear, the countries with strict regulations are a lot less popular and provide less trophies, when the regulation loosen a little the import rises quickly. One thing that is interesting is that countries with very loose regulations have a smaller impact than countries with strict regulations. This could be because these countries are generally not visited for the purpouse of hunting or have a different biodiversity that is not interesting for tophy hunting.</p>
