    <h1> Animals in captivity: Extinct in the Wild</h1>
    <p> This overview shows which animals are extinct in the wild, only living on in captivity. They are categorized
        per animal class and continent. Europe is excluded as there are no animals originally from
        Europe that are extinct in the wild. Data was retrieved from
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinct_in_the_wild">Wikipedia</a>,

    <h1>Animals in captivity: Consumption</h1>
    <p> This overview shows the total amount (in tons) of animals used for meat consumption in Europe. This amount
        is based on the weight of approved meat, meaning more animals were slaughtered than used eventually. This data
        was retrieved from the
        <a href="https://data.europa.eu/euodp/en/data/publisher/estat?q=production+of+meat&ext_boolean=all&sort=">EU Open Data Portal</a>.
        This information is indicative though not completely representative as not all European countries were included
        due to a lack of data for some (due to confidentiality). These countries were left out in all visualizations, meaning
        the total weight is higher and the proportions may differ slightly.</p>
    <p>The countries that were excluded are: <i>the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Norway, and Liechtenstein.</i></p>

    <h1>Animals in captivity: Entertainment</h1>
    <p> This overview shows the amount of zoos, aquaria, and dolphinariums in each continent,
        compared to its land size and population. It can provide insights in the factors that are important
        when deciding on building a zoo, aquarium, or dolphinarium. Is it a cultural preference? Is it based
        on present (or not present) animal diversity? Is it based on the geographical properties of your continent?
